# Caesar_Cipher
This is a Caesar_Cipher Decoder
You can put an encrypted sentece and it will decode that.
For now you need to see all the possible combinations for an encrypted sentence; but you can change the number of positions used in this for loop:

But there will be updates:
* Encode Function;
* Decode Function
* Friendly access interface;

To contribut you can pull request with new encrypted words/senteces that will be used as a sample
Put it here:
