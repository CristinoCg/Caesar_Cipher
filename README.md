# Caesar_Cipher
This is a Caesar_Cipher Decoder
You can put an encrypted sentece and it will decode that.
For now you need to see all the possible combinations for an encrypted sentence
But there will be updates:
*Function calling for the decode and encode
*Friendly access interface

To contribut you can pull request with new encrypted words/senteces that will be used as a sample
